# KeyboardOrchestra

A collaborative keyboard orchestra computer game
built with Unity and ChucK
inspired by toomanychefs.party

KeyboardOrchestra utilizes Open Sound Control to communicate key clicks between two computers, allowing the users the unique interaction of needing to use another keyboard to change their own screen's visuals. In this interactive game, two players work together to complete steps that compose a sonic piece right in front of them.

```
In Unity, decide on who is player 0 and player 1. Enter your player number in the "Player Number" field of the "Main Controller" script attached to the "Main" object.

Type in the IP address of the other computer and away you go!

Press the keys shown on the screen in time with the beat.
If the key is blue, it's on your keyboard. If it's pink, it's on the other keyboard.
If they're stacked on top of each other, you have to press them at the same time!
Build up the chord as you progress through the level :)

Watch out! The levels get faster and faster. If you don't press all your keys in time, your static starts to build. Make it through the next step and your static goes back down. Let your static build all the way and you lose!
