# KeyboardOrchestra

A collaborative keyboard orchestra computer game
built with Unity and ChucK
inspired by toomanychefs.party

KeyboardOrchestra utilizes Open Sound Control to communicate key clicks between two computers, allowing the users the unique interaction of needing to use another keyboard to change their own screen's visuals. In this interactive game, two players work together to complete steps that compose a sonic piece right in front of them.
